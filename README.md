# Smart Engineering Graphics Assessment Tool (SEGAT)

# Project Overview

The Smart Engineering Graphics Assessment Tool (SEGAT) is an innovative solution designed to assist college students in mastering engineering graphics concepts. Our tool harnesses the power of generative AI to analyze complex engineering graphics problems and provide tailored solutions, making learning more accessible and effective.

# Key Features

- **Generative AI Algorithms:** At the heart of SEGAT is our advanced generative AI engine, which interprets engineering graphics problems and generates step-by-step algorithms for solving them. This allows students to understand not just the "how," but also the "why" behind various techniques and methodologies.

- **Interactive Problem Solving:** Users can input a wide range of engineering graphics questions, from basic to advanced levels. The system is designed to respond with comprehensive solutions, generating visual outputs that illustrate the problem-solving process.

- **Dynamic Visualizations:** By leveraging generative AI models, SEGAT can produce 2D drawings and animations based on the algorithms developed. This visual representation enhances comprehension and retention of engineering concepts.

- **User-Centric Design:** Our platform is built with user experience in mind, allowing students to easily ask questions, upload documents, and receive instant feedback. The integration of a conversational AI (ChatGPT) enables seamless interaction, guiding users through the learning process.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the web interface.
  - **JavaScript:** To create interactive elements and manage user inputs.
  - **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid UI development with a utility-first approach.

- **Backend:**
  - **Firebase:** For real-time database management, user authentication, and hosting the application backend.

- **AI & Machine Learning:**
  - **OpenAI API (ChatGPT):** For generating natural language responses and guiding users through problem-solving.
  - **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) / Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** For creating visual outputs based on the algorithms developed.

- **Database:**
  - **Firebase Firestore:** For storing user data, problem inputs, and generated solutions.

- **Deployment:**
  - **Firebase Hosting:** For deploying the application and ensuring accessibility for users.

## Current Status

We are actively working on SEGAT, continuously improving its capabilities and refining the user experience. Please note that the project is still under development, and we are committed to delivering a robust and effective tool for engineering students.
